        <p>Hello! I am Carolina Pereira and I am an Educational Mentor. I believe that education is essential for individual 
            and social development and I am dedicated to helping people achieve their goals through learning new languages. I 
            believe in the importance of education to transform people's lives and make them more self-reliant. I believe 
            that each individual has the potential to become a better version of themselves, and I strive to help my students 
            and mentees achieve that potential. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I also 
            believe in the power of faith and prayer to guide us and help us overcome life's challenges.</p>
            
        <p>I have over 25 years of experience in language teaching, having worked in language schools and as a private tutor 
            and mentor. During this time, I have developed skills in lesson planning, effective communication with students, 
            and adaptation to each individual's needs.I completed my undergraduate degree in Philosophy (yes, Philosophy!) 
            at State University of Campinas in 2001. Since then, I have participated in several courses and workshops to stay 
            up-to-date on language teaching trends and techniques. I am currently pursuing studies in software development. 
            My decision to study software development was driven by my desire to make education more accessible and to promote 
            better outcomes through the use of technology.</p>
            
        <p>I have skills in language teaching, lesson planning, and effective communication with students from different 
            levels and backgrounds. I am also fluent in Portuguese, English, and I am developing Spanish and French. I have 
            participated in various projects to help individuals develop themselves through the Self-Reliance program 
            of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which includes an English language teaching program and a 
            career education program. In addition, I have assisted numerous students in preparing for international language 
            proficiency exams, such as Cambridge, TOEFL and IELTS. I am passionate about using my skills and experience to 
            empower individuals to achieve their goals and fulfill their potential.</p>
            
        <p>Besides language teaching, I am a person interested in music, theater, and travel. I enjoy exploring new places 
            and cultures, and sharing these experiences with my friends, students and mentees.</p>
