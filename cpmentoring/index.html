            <p>At CPMentoring, we offer comprehensive educational mentoring services to support your language 
                learning and personal growth. We understand that achieving fluency in English involves more than 
                just learning vocabulary and grammar; it requires guidance, motivation, and a supportive 
                environment.</p>

                    <p>"Many students do not reach their best performance due to lack of clarity in the objectives and 
                discipline to achieve them, and Carolina has these skills in abundance. Being mentored by her is the guarantee 
                of having clear objectives from the first contact, and the discipline to achieve them until the last. If it was 
                just that, the mentoring would already be worth it, however, it offers much more, and something that is very 
                lacking nowadays: ethics. Her outputs are fully aligned with her words, bringing peace of mind that the service 
                chosen will be the service delivered". (Paulo Henrique Sabino Ferreira, Financial Analyst - Brazil)</p>

                    <p>"Carolina analyzed my profile based on my motivational, learning, and organizational perceptions, 
                resulting in customized solutions for my personal and professional growth. She was one of the 
                people who knew how to say the right thing at the right time. I've been in situations where no 
                one believed in me while I was transitioning from a simple eyewear order packer in a warehouse 
                to a Cloud Systems Engineer in a Big Tech of Silicon Valley. I was very nervous, but she knew how 
                to read my behavioral patterns, and that's why I aced the interview that completely changed my 
                professional life". (Rodrigo Curvelo, Cloud Systems Engineer - USA)</p>

                    <p>"Carol's methodology surprised me and I was very excited with the ease with which she adapts to 
                        the student, after so many years without studying and with many addictions, 
                        today she manages to teach me something new all the time, but without putting too much 
                        pressure on me, because this is my profile, I like my comfort zone.
                        Participating in “75 Hard” with Carol is quite a challenge, she is very excited to teach 
                        and always has different ideas for content. Having the 75 days of study makes a big 
                        difference, the brain starts to think in English and sometimes I catch myself talking to 
                        myself in English.
                        Carol is charismatic, attentive, spontaneous and very intelligent, taking classes with 
                        her is very pleasant, I highly recommend it". (Janiny Rodrigues - Brazil)</p>

                    <p>"About four years ago I decided to study English because I wanted to travel abroad and I
                        didn't speak English, and I wanted to have personalized classes, only the teacher and me.
                        With Carol I could have classes that would meet my profile. Our classes have always been
                        very dynamic, and Carol brought movies, videos, music and some games to our classes to
                        complete my learning. She also gave me extra activities to practice at home. That's because 
                        Carol understood how I wanted out classes, without haste and in my time.
                        Our classes have always been committed to the best result. I can say that our partnership
                        works because today I feel more comfortable in another country and can understand and speak
                        better in English". (Elizete - Brazil)</p>
