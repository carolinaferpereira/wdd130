<strong>SECTION 3 - TESTIMONIALS</strong><br>

Person 1 - Yet to be written.<br>

Person 2 - "Carolina analyzed my profile through my motivational, learning and organizational perceptions, 
resulting in customized solutions for my personal and professional growth. She was one of those people who knew 
how to say the right thing at the right time. I've been in situations where no one believed me while I was 
transitioning from being a simple eyeglass order packer in a warehouse to a Cloud Systems Engineer at a Big Tech 
in Silicon Valley. I was very nervous, but I knew how to read my behavioral patterns, and that's why I did the 
interview that completely changed my professional life." (Rodrigo Curvelo, Cloud Systems Engineer - USA)<br>

Person 3 - "Many students do not reach their best performance due to lack of clarity in the objectives and 
discipline to achieve them, and Carolina has these skills in abundance. Being mentored by her is the guarantee 
of having clear objectives from the first contact, and the discipline to achieve them until the last. If it was 
just that, the mentoring would already be worth it, however, it offers much more, and something that is very 
lacking nowadays: ethics. Her outputs are fully aligned with her words, bringing peace of mind that the service 
chosen will be the service delivered." (Paulo Henrique Sabino Ferreira, Financial Analyst - Brazil)<br>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        PAGE 3 - ABOUT ME<br>

Hello! I am Carolina Pereira and I am an Educational Mentor. I believe that education is essential for individual 
and social development and I am dedicated to helping people achieve their goals through learning new languages.<br>

I believe in the importance of education to transform people's lives and make them more self-reliant. I believe 
that each individual has the potential to become a better version of themselves, and I strive to help my students 
and mentees achieve that potential. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I also 
believe in the power of faith and prayer to guide us and help us overcome life's challenges.<br>

I have over 25 years of experience in language teaching, having worked in language schools and as a private tutor 
and mentor. During this time, I have developed skills in lesson planning, effective communication with students, 
and adaptation to each individual's needs.<br>

I completed my undergraduate degree in Philosophy (yes, Philosophy!) at State University of Campinas in 2001. 
Since then, I have participated in several courses and workshops to stay up-to-date on language teaching trends 
and techniques. I am currently pursuing studies in software development. My decision to study software 
development was driven by my desire to make education more accessible and to promote better outcomes through the 
use of technology.<br>

I have skills in language teaching, lesson planning, and effective communication with students from different 
levels and backgrounds. I am also fluent in Portuguese, English, and I developing Spanish and French.<br>

I have participated in various projects to help individuals develop themselves through the Self-Reliance program 
of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which includes an English language teaching program and a 
career education program. In addition, I have assisted numerous students in preparing for international language 
proficiency exams, such as Cambridge, TOEFL and IELTS. I am passionate about using my skills and experience to 
empower individuals to achieve their goals and fulfill their potential.<br>

Besides language teaching, I am a person interested in music, theater, and travel. I enjoy exploring new places 
and cultures, and sharing these experiences with my friends, students and mentees.<br>
