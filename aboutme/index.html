    <h2>Carol</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Carolina Pereira and I am a language learning mentor and a member of The Church of Jesus 
        Christ of Latter-day Saints, currently serving as a self-reliance specialist. I believe that education is 
        essential for individual and social development and I am dedicated to helping people achieve their goals 
        through learning new languages.</p>
    <p>I believe in the importance of education to transform people's lives and make them more self-reliant. 
        I believe that each individual has the potential to become a better version of themselves, and I strive to 
        help my students achieve that potential. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 
        I also believe in the power of faith and prayer to guide us and help us overcome life's challenges.</p>
    <p>I have over 25 years of experience in language teaching, having worked in language schools and as a private 
        tutor and mentor. During this time, I have developed skills in lesson planning, effective communication with students, 
        and adaptation to each individual's needs.</p>
    <p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Philosophy at State University of Campinas in 2001. Since then, 
        I have participated in several courses and workshops to stay up-to-date on language teaching trends and 
        techniques. I am currently pursuing studies in software development. My decision to study software development 
        was driven by my desire to make education more accessible and to promote better outcomes through the use of 
        technology.</p>
    <p>I have skills in language teaching, lesson planning, and effective communication with students from different 
        levels and backgrounds. I am also fluent in Portuguese, English, and I am currently learning Spanish and French.</p>
    <p>I have participated in various projects to help individuals develop themselves through the Self-Reliance 
        program of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which includes an English language teaching 
        program and a career education program. In addition, I have assisted numerous students in preparing for 
        international language proficiency exams, such as Cambridge, TOEFL and IELTS. I am passionate about using my skills 
        and experience to empower individuals to achieve their goals and fulfill their potential.</p>
    <p>Besides language teaching, I am a person interested in music, theater, and travel. I enjoy exploring new 
        places and cultures, and sharing these experiences with my friends and students.</p>
